<!--

  Modify this file as you please like any other Svelte project. Do keep in mind
  that this functionality is still in the development stage, there's no telling
  what functions you add can or cannot break the frontend you sideload this app
  into.

  NOTE: any <style> tags in svelte files will be ignored. Module generation will use
        the **content.css** file instead.
