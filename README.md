# ArcOS-CustomApp-Template

This template can be used to create custom applications for ArcOS.

You can modify all files in this project except for:

- App.svelte
- types/\*.d.ts
- api.ts
- main.ts

Why? These have been modified to be able to sideload the app into ArcOS. Modifying them can - and likely will - cause issues.
