> [!WARNING]
> The implementation of application sideloading in ArcOS is still highly experimental. We don't yet know if and how much this affects system stability. ArcFS files and User Data _should not_ be at risk, but this too hasn't been confirmed.

This repository allows for creating Sideloaded applications in ArcOS.
